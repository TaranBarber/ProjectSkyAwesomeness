<h3>Earth's Year</h3>

<p>Earth has a year, which is the time it takes the Earth to go, revolve, around the sun. This time is around 365.25 days. That .25 is why leap years occur every four years, to make up for the lost fourth of a day in the previous three years. Also, the time is AROUND 365.25 days, but not exactly. Further leap year rules dealing with centuries try to adjust the timing of even more decimal places to be as exact as we can hope to be. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year 

	In the past, the Julian calendar was used to measure time. In the 16th century, however, most switched over to the Gregorian calendar, which we still use today. The Gregorian calendar was made to resolve issues from the additional decimal points, to keep the solstices and equinoxes around the same general time. Different cultures in some parts of the world also use different calendars, like the Persian calendar in Afghanistan and Iran as one example. All of these calendars are able to get the same general length. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars
