Light Pollution

	Light Pollution is the abundance of artificial light hitting the atmosphere and obscuring the stars in the night sky. Light pollution is caused mostly by cities and metropolitan areas, though other forms of light pollution exist. If you have lived in or been to a metropolitan area and can see an orange glow in the sky, called skyglow, you have seen one form of light pollution. Light pollution affects how people view the sky and can be a major detriment to your own star viewing. Steps are being taken to reduce the light pollution with more efficient lights, but until then, doing you star gazing from a rural area or small town away from a city is the best way to see as many stars as possible.
