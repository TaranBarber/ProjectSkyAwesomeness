Moon Phases

	The moon is tidally locked to Earth. Because of this, we can only ever see the one face of the moon. Also, since the moon revolves around Earth, which takes around 28 days, we see the moon at different points in its orbit. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking 

	New Moon is the first stage, when the moon cannot be seen as it is completely in the Sun's shadow. It is helpful to note that the New Moon rises at 6 a.m. and sets at 6 p.m. The next stage is the Waxing Crescent, where one to forty-nine percent of the moon is visible. First Quarter is when half the moon is visible, with it rising at noon and setting at midnight. Waxing Gibbous is between fifty-one and ninety-nine percent of visibility. The Full Moon is the apex of when we can see the moon. It rises at 6 p.m. and sets at 6 a.m., showing the entire face of the moon for us to see.

	On the falling side, the Waning Gibbous is next. It shows the reverse of the ninety-nine to fifty-one percent visibility. Third Quarter is the waning half moon stage, with it rising at midnight and setting at noon. Waning Crescent is the falling forty-nine to one percent visiblity. Finally, the cycle completes and the New Moon appears again. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase
