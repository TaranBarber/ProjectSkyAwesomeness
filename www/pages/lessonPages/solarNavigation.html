Solar Navigation

	Navigating using the sun during the day is not difficult if the time of the year and where in the world you are located is known. Generally, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. So to go east, go toward the sun in the morning and away from it setting in the evening. However, it is more complicated than that because of Earth's elliptical orbit around the sun. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit 

	The elliptical orbit, where the Earth is not always the same distance or direction away from the sun, and tilt of the Earth also causes seasons to happen. So during the vernal (around March 20) and autumnal (around September 22) equinoxes, the sun is equal to true east and west when rising and setting, respectively. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox During the summer, however, the sun is closer to the north and during the winter it is closer to the south (in the Northern hemisphere). During the peak of these times, the summer (around June) and winter (around December ) solstices, the sun will rise and set in the northeast and northwest, and southeast and southwest, respectively. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice 

	Therefore, if you know what time of the year you are in, closer to which of the four events, and where you are in the world, what hemisphere as well as where in it since the angle is more pronounced the farther from the equator you are, you can determine direction. For example, say it is morning in the Northern Hemisphere during April and you want to head north. Well, you know that since it is just after the equinox the sun is facing very slightly north of east, so you simply go in the direction about 80 degrees left of that.

Now try it somehow.
