<p>A <a style='font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse">lunar eclipse</a> is when, during the orbit of the moon, the Earth is at a point directly between the moon and the Sun. This means that the night of a full moon is the only possible time for this to occur. The sun in this instance casts the Earth's shadow onto the Moon, making the moon invisible for a brief period of time. Unlike solar eclipses where only certain parts of Earth are able to see it at any given time, the entire night side of the Earth can see a lunar eclipse. You should still check to see what time will be best for viewing the eclipse.</p>
